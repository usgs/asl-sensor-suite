This data is used in multiple tests to verify integrity of azimuth
calculation components. Tests exist to check that the data has its mean 
removed, that it is filtered correctly, and that the correct azimuth
result has been returned. Expected azimuth is 3.4 taken over time range
02:00:00 to 13:00:00.
